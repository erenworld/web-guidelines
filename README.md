* design and optimize for two classes of users: anonymous, and logged in. (We minimize the footprint of HTML, CSS and Javascript for anonymous users so they get their pages even faster. We load a stub of very basic functionality and dynamically “rez in” things like editing when the user focuses the answer input area. For logged in users, the footprint is necessarily larger, but we can also add features for our most avid community members at will without fear of harming the experience of the vast, silent majority of anonymous users)
